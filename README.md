# Module 3 Challenge

## Objective:
* Create a random password generator. The user can choose different criterias that apply to the password.
* The user can choose the length of the password (8-128 charactors).
* The user can confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
* The user's input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
* After the user answered all prompts, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## The Outcome:
* A prompt will appear when the user clicks "generate password" button.
